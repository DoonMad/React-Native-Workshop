## 🧰 Technologies & Concepts Covered

* **React Native + Expo**: Cross-platform app development using TypeScript.
* **Expo Router**: Navigation and screen structure.
* **React Hooks**:

  * `useState`: Managing state within components.
  * `useEffect`: Running side effects like API calls.
  * `useLocalSearchParams`: Reading parameters from the route
* **API Integration** with OpenWeatherMap.
* **Location Access** using Expo Location.
* **Styling** with Flexbox and reusable styles.
* **Environment Variables** using @env for API keys.
* **Git & GitHub**: Repo creation, committing code, pushing changes.

## 🚀 What We'll Build

### 🧮 BMI Calculator App

* A simple app that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.
* Learnings:

  * Basic components (`View`, `Text`, `TextInput`, `Button`)
  * Handling user input using `useState`
  * Performing calculations and conditional rendering
  * Creating clean, user-friendly UI

### ☁️ Weather App

* A location-based weather app using OpenWeatherMap’s API.
* Learnings:

  * Using `expo-location` to get the device's current coordinates
  * Fetching weather data using latitude & longitude
  * Enhancing UI with expo-linear-gradient
  * Creating a utility API module (`api/weather.ts`) to handle external API calls
  * Displaying fetched data like temperature, weather conditions, etc.
  * Error handling and loading states

## 📚 Bonus Concepts

* Reusable utility functions
* Using TypeScript interfaces for type-safe API responses
* How to read and structure a public API response
* Project structuring best practices in React Native
* Environment variables using `@env`
* Quick intro to debugging and console logging
